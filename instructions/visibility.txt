Generate code for equations 1 - 14 in the paper PhysRevD.109.123029.pdf for an abstract intensity I_nu(nu,\hat{n}) using a modular design suited for a general-purpose package.

Intensities may have analytic or efficient implementations of visibility and normalized fringe visibility.

Use FFT to efficiently solve integrals.

Include in test module a reproduction of the plot in Figure 1.
